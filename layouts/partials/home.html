    <h1>Personal Branding or Self Expression</h1>
    <p>
      Apparently, personal websites are good for careers.  But I want this to be authentic. So I may take a while to do this, because an authentic personal brand seems oxymoronic. Isn't most of career building about being fake and inauthentic? Especially for people of color (ever heard of code switching)?

      So I don't know if this is about personal branding or self expression. But only one seems pure. And the name of this site is handelldesul.me, so what does that represent?
