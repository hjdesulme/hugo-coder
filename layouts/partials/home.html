    <h1>Aye yo! Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>
      Sakapfet? (What’s up?) Thanks for visiting. I’ll keep things brief. I have a few goals in mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>to write and maintain a blog where I:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>share my ideas on eliminating gatekeeping in software and broader scientific domains.</li>
        <li>demystify and translate obscure and linguistically unfamiliar software and broader scientific concepts.</li>
        <li>share my perspectives and experiences as a Haitian African-American kid from the hood in Philly on the corporate Silicon Valley tech hub</li>
      </ul>
      <li>to self-promote and personally brand myself as a reliable source of information. There’s no avoiding this. I ask that you keep me honest while achieving this goal.</li>  
    </ol>
    <p>Who am I? As I mentioned, I’m just a guy who grew up in the hood in uptown Philadelphia. I’m a Haitian African-American, a former rapper, a former digital marketer, and presently a software engineer. My story is uniquely my own and I have a lot to share.</p>
