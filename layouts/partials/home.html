    <h1>Hey! Thanks for dropping by.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a full-stack software engineer who's still searching for a niche üïµüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I worked at Rivian and freelanced/consulted through PromptHand Software, LLC most recently, where I touched lots of the standard web technologies (React, JavaScript, Python, Kubernetes, etc.) to build SAAS products.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to do lots of things in my free time. But nothing beats learning ü§ì. (Well a few things beat learning, but you get my point.)
    </p>
    <p> 
      You're here early. I'll be adding blog posts and sharing portfolio projects soon. Stay tuned.
