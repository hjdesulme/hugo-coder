    <h1>Welcome to my humble website.</h1>
    <p>
      I'll spare you the biography (you can find that in my blog). I've worn many hats, but I enjoy wearing the software guy hat the most. I'm a full-stack web developer and a jack of all trades, though I'd like to specialize in something on the backend side of things. I'm currently exploring a few different paths and I have a big SaaS project that keeps me occupied in my free time. Anyways, I plan on upgrading this space over time, but this where things are at the moment. Feel free to explore.
