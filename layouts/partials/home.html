    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic software engineer and evergreen student. My career began in San Franscisco at iCrossing as a Search Engine Marketing professional. As an autodidact wanting to gain employment as a software engineer, I laboriously studied computer science and programming until I was offered a role at Rivian to be a Software Engineer II. There, I was a Full-Stack Developer on the Fleet Core team working on their enterprise SaaS platform. Now, I am continuing to explore various domains in the realm of backend engineering.
